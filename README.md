# react-express-weather-report
React express based application for generating weather reports.

This application is based on create react app. Express server will be added to massage the data and hide API keys. This should help to keep Front End application clean. 

Intention will be on using hooks instead classes. 

Runing instructions app in dev mode: 
'npm i' in root also 'npm i' in client folder and then 'npm run dev'. 
Note this will run two application together, FE and BE. 

Note: you might need to install nodemon globally. 'npm install -g nodemon'.
